# t-ui2

I need to rewrite t-ui in order to allow more people to contribute, since actually the code is a mess and I'm the only who can understand what's happening. It has become a pain to add new features. I hope this refactoring can make t-ui a proper open source project, with a lot of contributors from all over the world. Thank you!
